 Integrate tldraw sync Into diagram-tools-hub
üß† Background
You are working with the project diagram-tools-hub, a unified Docker-based environment for serving multiple visual diagramming tools including Draw.io, Excalidraw, and TLDraw. The project is orchestrated entirely via a management script called manage-config.sh, which is responsible for:

Injecting configuration into docker-compose.yml and nginx.conf

Managing service lifecycle: start, stop, rebuild, logs, etc.

Managing SSL certificates (auto-generated or user-supplied)

Ensuring all services are reverse-proxied behind an nginx frontend container (engine)

All service access is via HTTPS through the engine container. No direct service ports should be exposed or used for any feature.

üéØ Goal
Add support for real-time multi-user collaboration to the TLDraw component using tldraw sync, the officially supported collaboration system by the TLDraw team. You must implement this by self-hosting the sync backend within the Docker-based architecture of the current project, such that collaboration is available both during local testing and in production deployments.

Use the official documentation at https://tldraw.dev/docs/sync and base your implementation on the "simple server example" provided here:

https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/blob/main/templates/simple-server-example/src/client/App.tsx

Also review and use best practices described under "Integrate tldraw sync into your own backend" in the docs.

üìå Requirements & Constraints
üîí Modification Scope
You must make all changes via manage-config.sh only.

Do not manually alter docker-compose.yml, nginx.conf, or run docker-compose directly.

Use appropriate logic in manage-config.sh to inject, modify, and validate configurations.

Do not alter or regress the functionality of the existing Draw.io, Excalidraw, or TLDraw deployments.

All existing reverse proxy routing and container dependencies must be preserved as-is.

üåê Access & Proxy Rules
All access to the tldraw sync backend should be routed through engine (nginx) at path:
/tldraw-sync/<roomId>

Do not expose the sync server via a public port or bind to host IP.

Ensure correct reverse proxy configuration in nginx.conf is added via the script.

üß© Architecture
You will be adding a new container service to the system, which hosts the tldraw sync backend, implemented using @tldraw/sync-core. This container must:

Expose a WebSocket endpoint to receive collaborative sync traffic

Internally manage TLSocketRoom instances (one per room ID)

Optionally support snapshot persistence (basic file-based or in-memory is fine)

Handle bookmark URL unfurling as described in the tldraw docs

üìÅ Folder Layout
Follow existing layout conventions. The new backend service should be placed in a subfolder like:

go
Copy
Edit
diagram-tools-hub/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tldraw-sync-backend/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js (or equivalent)
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
The Dockerfile must create a minimal production container, based on Node.js or Bun (based on what yields simpler implementation).

üõ†Ô∏è Required Implementation Steps
‚úÖ 1. Add Sync Backend as a Docker Container
Create a new service named tldraw-sync in docker-compose.yml via script injection.

It must:

Be based on a Node or Bun container with the @tldraw/sync-core server logic.

Support in-memory document storage (can be extended to file or DB if needed).

Run a WebSocket endpoint at /connect/<roomId> as per tldraw sync expectations.

Add appropriate depends_on entries to ensure it's available to the engine container.

‚úÖ 2. Add Reverse Proxy Entry in NGINX Config
Modify (via script) the nginx configuration to include a reverse proxy rule like:

nginx
Copy
Edit
location /tldraw-sync/ {
    proxy_pass http://tldraw-sync:3001/;  # or whatever internal port is used
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
}
Ensure proxy_set_header directives are present for WebSocket support.

Validate SSL and redirect compatibility remain intact.

‚úÖ 3. Modify TLDraw Frontend to Use Sync
Modify the TLDraw frontend codebase (in ./tldraw/) to use the useSync() hook from @tldraw/sync.

Provide the WebSocket uri as:

ts
Copy
Edit
uri: `${window.location.origin.replace(/^http/, 'ws')}/tldraw-sync/${roomId}`
Implement and plug in:

A valid TLAssetStore for handling uploads (use stub or file storage)

registerExternalAssetHandler() for unfurling bookmark URLs

You can initially stub asset upload/unfurling to return dummy values or do local file I/O, but make the code extendable to support cloud or persistent asset storage.

‚úÖ 4. Extend manage-config.sh
Update the manage-config.sh script to:

Inject the tldraw-sync service definition into docker-compose.yml if not present

Inject the nginx reverse proxy config

Ensure idempotent behavior: repeated runs of the script should not duplicate config

Support start, stop, restart, rebuild, and logs commands for the new service

Optionally allow enabling/disabling the sync backend via a feature flag in .env

‚úÖ 5. Testing Support
Allow local testing via localhost, fully reverse-proxied through engine.

Ensure collaboration works between two browser tabs sharing the same room ID.

Test unfurling and image upload functionality using real or stubbed logic.

üß™ Bonus: Extendability & Production Readiness
If feasible, include:

Room data persistence (via file snapshots or Redis/volume mount)

Proper room cleanup on exit

Environment variable support for the sync backend (e.g., logging level, port)

Docs or inline comments on how to add support for custom shape schemas

üîç Deliverables to Produce
Once complete, ensure these are working and included:

tldraw-sync service defined in docker-compose

tldraw-sync-backend/ folder with Dockerfile + code

Updated manage-config.sh that:

Adds the service

Configures nginx

Handles lifecycle management

TLDraw frontend updated to use real-time sync

Testing notes or test plan to validate local multi-user collaboration

Any new files or dependencies committed to appropriate locations

üîé Notes & Best Practices
Do not hardcode any values. Read ports, flags, and environment config from .env or pass via Docker.

Ensure the new feature does not slow down startup, increase memory overhead significantly, or introduce security vulnerabilities (e.g., unrestricted WebSocket echo servers).

Log meaningfully, but avoid excessive output by default.

Ensure compatibility with current CI/CD and systemd support.

üß† Prompt for AI Agent (Verbose, Comprehensive, and State-Aware)

You are enhancing the diagram-tools-hub project by adding multi-user real-time sync support for tldraw, using @tldraw/tldraw‚Äôs useSync() hook and the official sync server implementation described here:
üìò Docs: https://tldraw.dev/docs/sync
üìÅ Reference example: https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/tree/main/templates/simple-server-example

‚úÖ Current Project Context
This project orchestrates diagramming tools using Docker Compose and a reverse proxy based on nginx.

All services (e.g., draw.io, excalidraw, tldraw) are exposed via the nginx container.

All configuration and container management is done exclusively through manage-config.sh‚Äîyou must not directly edit docker-compose.yml or nginx.conf unless done through this script.

You have already started implementing support for tldraw sync:

You attempted to add a sync server (likely in Node.js or Express) as a Docker container.

You modified tldraw‚Äôs frontend code to use useSync() and constructed a sync URI using WebSocket (wss://localhost:8080/tldraw-sync/...).

You made changes to nginx to try to forward /tldraw-sync/ to the sync server.

The store status is stuck in loading‚Äîpossibly due to failure to establish WebSocket connection or an initialization bug.

üîç Current Issue (as seen in browser console)

Edit
Current protocol: https:
Current host: localhost:8080
WebSocket protocol: wss:
TLDraw Sync URI: wss://localhost:8080/tldraw-sync/connect/test-room1
Room ID: test-room1
Store status: loading
WebSocket upgrade to /tldraw-sync/connect/... appears to be failing silently.

There‚Äôs no transition to ‚Äúready‚Äù state, suggesting that:

WebSocket is not connecting

nginx is not forwarding wss:// traffic properly to the backend

or the sync server is not responding as expected

You likely do not need to re-implement everything from scratch. Instead, resume intelligently using what‚Äôs already present and fix forward.

üõ†Ô∏è What You Need to Do
Please resume implementation intelligently using the current state of the project. Do not reset progress unless necessary. Your primary goal now is to debug and finalize the sync integration end-to-end. Specifically:

üß© Step-by-Step Checklist
Diagnose the ‚Äúloading‚Äù issue:

Confirm whether the tldraw frontend is successfully establishing a WebSocket connection.

Add debug logs to both client and server to confirm that /tldraw-sync/connect/:roomId is:

Reaching the server through nginx

Establishing WebSocket upgrade

Responding appropriately

Validate nginx reverse proxy settings:

Ensure nginx.conf has the correct location /tldraw-sync/ block:

WebSocket headers (Upgrade, Connection) are correctly forwarded.

The path is rewritten if needed (/tldraw-sync/ ‚Üí / on backend).

Ports match the container‚Äôs exposed WebSocket listener.

Example directive to include if missing:

nginx
Copy
Edit
location /tldraw-sync/ {
    proxy_pass http://tldraw-sync:8081/;  # adjust as per docker network
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
}
Check the sync server container:

Verify that the tldraw-sync container is:

Running and accepting WebSocket connections

Logging errors if it fails to connect

Listening on the expected port (e.g., 8081)

Fix Dockerfile and Compose config through manage-config.sh only if ports/paths are misaligned.

Verify frontend sync code:

Confirm that useSync(roomId, { uri: 'wss://...' }) is correctly pointing to the proxy path.

Ensure asset store (TLAssetStore) and unfurling URLs are initialized.

Log all events in the tldraw app: store status, WebSocket open/close, error messages.

Fix forward any broken parts:

If the sync server is misbehaving, refactor only that part.

If nginx is blocking WebSockets, adjust config via script.

If frontend isn‚Äôt emitting expected events, update sync logic using the example App.tsx.

Test the entire system locally:

Use two tabs or browsers with the same room ID.

Draw on one and confirm that updates reflect in the other.

Log all key events: WebSocket open, handshake, store ready, remote updates.

Add manage-config.sh support (if not already):

Modify script to:

Add/enable tldraw-sync container in Compose

Patch nginx rules automatically (e.g., inject location block)

Apply .env config if needed (hostnames, ports)

Rebuild affected containers automatically

üß™ Final Validation
Ensure the following work before considering it done:

‚úÖ Two or more users can draw on the same tldraw canvas in real time

‚úÖ Assets and links are synchronized across clients

‚úÖ manage-config.sh reliably sets up the whole stack (compose, nginx, env)

‚úÖ System is secure and stable (no open ports, proper WebSocket headers)

üß† Remember
Don‚Äôt remove or break other tools (draw.io, excalidraw)

Don‚Äôt directly run docker compose commands‚Äîonly modify the orchestration script

Avoid hardcoding hostnames or ports where not needed

Keep things modular, testable, and robust

Begin by analyzing the current state of sync backend, nginx proxy, and frontend connection. Add debug logs where needed and continue from where the previous agent left off.
