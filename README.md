[![Release Management](https://github.com/vppillai/diagram-tools-hub/workflows/ðŸš€%20Release%20Management/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vppillai/diagram-tools-hub/actions/workflows/release.yml)

A unified Docker setup that brings together three powerful diagramming tools under one roof:
- **Draw.io** - Professional diagrams and flowcharts
- **Excalidraw** - Hand-drawn style diagrams and wireframes  
- **TLDraw** - Modern collaborative drawing canvas

## Quick Start

Clone and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vppillai/diagram-tools-hub.git
cd diagram-tools-hub
./manage-config.sh start
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

## What's Included

- **Unified Dashboard** - Single page to access all tools
- **Direct Links** - Each tool available at its own path
- **Real-time Status** - See which tools are online
- **Easy Management** - Simple scripts to start/stop/restart

## Access Points

- **Main Hub**: http://localhost:8080
- **Draw.io**: http://localhost:8080/drawio/
- **Excalidraw**: http://localhost:8080/excalidraw/
- **TLDraw**: http://localhost:8080/tldraw/

## Requirements

- Docker & Docker Compose
- 2GB+ RAM
- Port 8080 available

## Management

The `manage-config.sh` script handles most operations:

```bash
./manage-config.sh start      # Start all services
./manage-config.sh stop       # Stop all services  
./manage-config.sh restart    # Restart everything
./manage-config.sh status     # Check service status
./manage-config.sh logs       # View logs
./manage-config.sh rebuild    # Rebuild containers
```

## HTTPS Support

### Automatic HTTPS

HTTPS is enabled by default with auto-generated self-signed certificates:

```bash
./manage-config.sh start
# Automatically generates SSL certificates and starts with HTTPS
# Access: https://localhost (HTTP redirects to HTTPS)
```

### Custom Certificate

Use your own SSL certificate:

```bash
./manage-config.sh start /path/to/cert.pem /path/to/key.pem
# Uses your custom certificates
```

### HTTP-Only Mode

Switch to HTTP-only (no SSL):

```bash
./manage-config.sh http-only
# Switches to HTTP-only mode on port 8080
```

### HTTPS Features

- **Automatic Setup** - SSL certificates generated automatically if not present
- **HTTP â†’ HTTPS Redirect** - All HTTP traffic redirects to HTTPS
- **Security Headers** - HSTS, X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.
- **Modern TLS** - TLS 1.2/1.3 with secure cipher suites
- **Flexible** - Use custom certificates or auto-generated ones

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The `.env` file allows you to customize ports and other settings:

```bash
# External Port Configuration
HTTP_PORT=8080              # HTTP port (when HTTPS is disabled)
HTTPS_PORT=443              # HTTPS port
HTTP_REDIRECT_PORT=80       # HTTP redirect port (when HTTPS is enabled)

# SSL Configuration
SSL_DOMAIN=localhost        # Domain for SSL certificate generation

# TLDraw settings
TLDRAW_DEBUG_PANEL=false

# Development settings  
NODE_ENV=production
ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false
ENABLE_TELEMETRY=false
```

### Custom Ports

Simply update the `.env` file to use different ports:

```bash
# Use custom ports
HTTP_PORT=9000
HTTPS_PORT=8443
HTTP_REDIRECT_PORT=8080
```

Then restart the services:
```bash
./manage-config.sh restart
```

## Architecture

- **Engine** (Nginx) - Serves the dashboard and routes traffic
- **Draw.io** - Professional diagramming tool
- **Excalidraw** - Hand-drawn style diagrams
- **TLDraw** - Modern collaborative canvas

## Troubleshooting

### Services won't start

Check if ports are in use:
```bash
lsof -i :8080-8083
```

### View logs

```bash
./manage-config.sh logs
# or
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Rebuild containers

```bash
./manage-config.sh rebuild
```

### TLDraw build issues

TLDraw builds from source. If it fails:

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache tldraw
```

## Development

### Local development

```bash
# Start with development settings
NODE_ENV=development docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f tldraw
```

### Adding new tools

1. Add service to `docker-compose.yml`
2. Update `engine/nginx.conf` with proxy rules
3. Add tool card to `engine/html/index.html`

## Releases

Docker images are automatically built and published on releases:

```bash
# Pull latest images
docker pull ghcr.io/vppillai/diagram-tools-hub/tldraw:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/vppillai/diagram-tools-hub/engine:latest
```
