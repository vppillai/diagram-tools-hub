- **Health Check**: https://localhost:8080/health

## Service Management

The `manage-config.sh` script handles all operations:

### Basic Operations
```bash
./manage-config.sh start      # Start all services in production mode (optimized, minified)
./manage-config.sh start-dev  # Start all services in development mode (hot-reload, debugging)
./manage-config.sh stop       # Stop all services
./manage-config.sh restart    # Restart all services
./manage-config.sh rebuild    # Rebuild containers and restart (production mode)
./manage-config.sh rebuild-dev # Rebuild containers and restart (development mode)
./manage-config.sh status     # Show container status and resource usage
```

### Configuration Commands
```bash
./manage-config.sh show           # Display current configuration  
./manage-config.sh http-only      # Switch to HTTP-only mode (disable SSL)
./manage-config.sh cleanup        # Remove conflicting containers/networks
./manage-config.sh clean-rebuild  # Complete rebuild from scratch
```

### Maintenance Commands
```bash
./manage-config.sh prune                    # Remove unused Docker resources
./manage-config.sh backup-config           # Backup current configuration
./manage-config.sh restore-config [FILE]   # Restore configuration from backup
```

### Individual Service Management
```bash
./manage-config.sh restart tldraw        # Restart specific service
./manage-config.sh rebuild tldraw-sync   # Rebuild and restart specific service
./manage-config.sh logs tldraw          # View logs for specific service
./manage-config.sh stop drawio          # Stop specific service

# Available services: engine, drawio, excalidraw, tldraw, tldraw-sync
```

### TLDraw Monitoring Commands
```bash
./manage-config.sh tldraw-monitor    # Comprehensive TLDraw system dashboard
./manage-config.sh tldraw-rooms      # TLDraw room statistics and collaboration usage
./manage-config.sh tldraw-health     # TLDraw sync backend health and API status  
./manage-config.sh system-metrics    # Docker container performance metrics
./manage-config.sh system-stats      # Real-time container resource usage
```

## Auto-Start System Service

Install as a systemd service for automatic startup on server reboot:

```bash
# Install service (requires sudo)
sudo ./manage-config.sh install-service

# Check service status
./manage-config.sh service-status

# Uninstall service (requires sudo)
sudo ./manage-config.sh uninstall-service
```

Once installed, manage with systemctl:
```bash
sudo systemctl start/stop/restart drawapp
sudo journalctl -u drawapp -f  # View service logs
```

The service automatically handles SSL generation, container management, and restart on failure.

## HTTPS Support

### Automatic HTTPS (Default)
HTTPS is enabled by default with auto-generated self-signed certificates:
- RSA 2048-bit keys with 365-day validity
- Subject Alternative Names for localhost and IP addresses
- HTTP automatically redirects to HTTPS
- Modern security headers and TLS configuration

### Custom Certificates
```bash
./manage-config.sh start /path/to/cert.pem /path/to/key.pem
```

### HTTP-Only Mode
```bash
./manage-config.sh http-only
```

## üí° Usage Tips & Best Practices

### TLDraw Collaboration Tips
- **Room Names**: Use descriptive room names like `/tldraw/project-design` or `/tldraw/team-brainstorm`
- **Color Shortcuts**: Press number keys 1-9 for instant color changes while drawing
- **Asset Sharing**: Paste images directly - they're automatically uploaded and shared with collaborators
- **URL Bookmarks**: Paste URLs to create rich bookmark cards with previews
- **Performance**: Use production mode (`./manage-config.sh start`) for best performance with multiple users

### Deployment Best Practices
- **Production**: Always use `./manage-config.sh start` for production deployments
- **Development**: Use `./manage-config.sh start-dev` only for active development
- **Monitoring**: Regularly check `./manage-config.sh tldraw-health` for system status
- **Maintenance**: Run `./manage-config.sh prune` periodically to clean up unused Docker resources
- **Backups**: Use `./manage-config.sh backup-config` before major updates

### Security Recommendations
- **Custom Certificates**: Replace self-signed certificates with proper SSL certificates for production
- **Firewall**: Restrict access to port 8080 to authorized users only
- **Updates**: Keep the system updated by pulling latest releases regularly
- **Room Cleanup**: Old rooms and assets are automatically cleaned up (configurable retention periods)

## Releases

Docker images are automatically built and published:
```bash
